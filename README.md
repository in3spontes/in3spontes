Hello there 👋🏻  

I'm an incoming Masters' student in Engineering Physics at Técnico Lisboa.

My main academic and research interest is Medical Physics, both on the Nuclear and Radiological branch. I've tailored my Masters degree to accomodate these interests and still give me strong foundations in other subjects, such as Nuclear and Plasma Physics and Nanoelectronics.

I'm also undertaking a voluntary Seminar in Mathematics, where I'll be exploring Maxwell's Equations across dimensions.

I'm a member of NuclearVision Portugal, a group of students that aims to raise awareness to the advantages of using Nuclear Energy as an alternative to fossil fuels.
